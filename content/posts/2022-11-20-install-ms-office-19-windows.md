## Activate the MS Office

Yep, this is the last step that you have to do, you have to run the activator file which you will get in your extracted folder.

Before the run Activator, you have to disable antivirus or windows defender.

![select,disable](https://gorepairhub.github.io/images/2022-11-20-install-ms-office-19-windows/win-security.png)


Here, I'm assuming you have disabled your antivirus or windows defender.

Right-click on your activator setup file and select ***Run As A administrator.
