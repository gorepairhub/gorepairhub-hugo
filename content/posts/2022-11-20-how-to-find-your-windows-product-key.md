* you have to download the same version of your windows-ios  and make a bootable pan-drive for reinstallation  and then backup important data then format your computer  where the virus and any other issue that occurred in your computer is also resolved and then activate the windows by using a key (00000-00000-00000-00000-00000) 

Yeah, you got the windows og key then the windows reinstallation process, and use it.

I hope it helps you, If you are finding an issue contact me on Twitter.
