### method-2
Command Prompt

To check the health of a hard disk drive (HDD), you can use a tool called "Check Disk" or "chkdsk." This tool is built into the Windows operating system and can be used to scan the HDD for errors and fix any problems that are found. Here is how to use the Check Disk tool on a Windows computer:

Open the "Start" menu and type "cmd" into the search bar.

Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator" from the context menu.

![select,run](https://gorepairhub.github.io/images/2022-11-20-how-to-check-your-HDD-SSD-health/run-cmd.png)

In the Command Prompt window, type "chkdsk" followed by the name of the HDD that you want to check. For example, if the HDD is labeled as "F:" you would type "chkdsk F:"

![select,f](https://gorepairhub.github.io/images/2022-11-20-how-to-check-your-HDD-SSD-health/cmd-chkdsk.png)


Press "Enter" to begin the scan. The Check Disk tool will automatically scan the HDD and display any errors or problems that it finds.

If any errors are found, the Check Disk tool will prompt you to repair them. To repair the errors, you will need to run the tool again, this time with the "chkdsk /f" command. This will instruct the tool to fix any errors that it finds.

Once the scan and repair process is complete, you can check the health of the HDD by running the "chkdsk /r" command. This will display a detailed report of the HDD's health, including its overall status and any errors that were found.

It is important to regularly check the health of your HDD to ensure that it is functioning properly and that your data is not at risk. If you notice any problems or errors when running the Check Disk tool, you may need to replace the HDD or seek professional assistance to repair it.
