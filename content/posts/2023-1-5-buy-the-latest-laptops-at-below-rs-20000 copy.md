Hi Friends,

Welcome to goRepairHub,

If you want to buy a laptop under 20000 there are many laptops available on the market but I  don't suggest buying AMD laptops because there hanging problems in the laptops I suggest buying an intel laptop with storage SSD because compared to HDD SSD works 5 times faster than HDD.

 if you are looking for a small laptop or two-in-one which is light and portable to do some work on Microsoft Office, Outlook, quotation, Gmail, etc., and have a budget of 20000 this is a laptop you must buy.
If you are a student and don't want to play demanding games and want to purchase laptops for elders in the house, buy this laptop.
