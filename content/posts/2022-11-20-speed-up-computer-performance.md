## hardware
upgrade  your laptop     

*if you want to upgrade your laptop then you have to first backup important data*

# Ssd 
SSD is usually 5 to 6 times faster than HDD and has a longer lifespan than HDD because SSD does not have moving parts and Hard drive typically has several platters which are mounted on the same spindle.

![select,ssd](https://gorepairhub.github.io/images/2022-11-20-speed-up-computer-performance/hard-sp.png)

# Ram
Most laptops usually have an extra RAM slot where you can plug the extra RAM module. If you donâ€™t have an extra RAM slot, you can remove the existing RAM and replace it with a higher-capacity RAM.

![select,ram](https://gorepairhub.github.io/images/2022-11-20-speed-up-computer-performance/ram-up.png)

<b> To know if your laptop supports additional RAM, you can run software such as" Crucial System Scanner" or "CPU-Z "on your system</b>.
