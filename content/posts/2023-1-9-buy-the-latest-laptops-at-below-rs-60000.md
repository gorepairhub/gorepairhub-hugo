Hi Friends,

Welcome to goRepairHub,

If you want to buy a laptop under 60000 there are many laptops available on the market but I  don't suggest buying AMD laptops because there hanging problems in the laptops I suggest buying an intel laptop with storage SSD because compared to HDD SSD works 5 times faster than HDD.
