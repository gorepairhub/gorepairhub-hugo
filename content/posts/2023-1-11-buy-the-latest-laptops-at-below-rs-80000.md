Hi Friends,

Welcome to goRepairHub,

If you want to buy a laptop under 60000 there are many laptops available on the market but I  don't suggest buying AMD laptops because there hanging problems in the laptops I suggest buying an intel laptop with storage SSD because compared to HDD SSD works 5 times faster than HDD.

All things are good. please who are purchasing should check all the packaging and start the laptop in front of the delivery boy. Also, check all the laptops and accessories and then start the laptop then check all software details and warranty after that can give otp.

## Lenovo Legion 5 

We all know that legion provides the best quality which matters a lot if you want it to last for atleast 4-5 years. This laptop is beast. Just blindly go for it u won't regret. Also it has a 95w tgp graphics card so it outperforms every laptop in this segment. Don't worry about the processor, it's a little old cpu but it has 6 cores and 12 threads which performs really great. You will have no problems or lag while doing any sort of work. Also it has a mux switch. Therefore I'm quite satisfied with this laptop!!!!

Guaranteed power: With 11th Gen Intel Core processors, you can revel in powerful performance without interrupting your gaming, streaming or videos. Keep cool: The Alienware-inspired thermal design incorporates a dual air-intake from the top of the keyboard and the bottom of the G15. This air is then expelled through the four vents located on the sides and rear to maximize airflow over the copper pipes for optimal cooling and heat dissipation. Improved power: The latest advancements to the thermal design give the G15 the headroom to deliver ample power while adapting to a changing system load. This allows components to stay cooler, and clock speeds to remain higher while running even the most demanding applications. Full speed ahead: Choose between optional Killer Wi-Fi 6 AX1650* or Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201* to ensure low latency gaming, smooth HD streaming video, and interruption-free voice and video chats.
