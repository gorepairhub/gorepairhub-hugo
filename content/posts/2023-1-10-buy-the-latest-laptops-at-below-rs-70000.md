Hi Friends,

Welcome to goRepairHub,

If you want to buy a laptop under 60000 there are many laptops available on the market but I  don't suggest buying AMD laptops because there hanging problems in the laptops I suggest buying an intel laptop with storage SSD because compared to HDD SSD works 5 times faster than HDD.

All things are good. please who are purchasing should check all the packaging and start the laptop in front of the delivery boy. Also, check all the laptops and accessories and then start the laptop then check all software details and warranty after that can give otp.

This is allrounder for coding and gaming
So far so good, been using this for the last 6-7 days. I've done heavy gaming and it does heat a bit but the thermals of this laptop are quite good. The fans are really good and don't make much noise. It can run all of your heavy games at max or close to max settings. I got the 512 GB and 16 GB versions at a bargain price of 69k. At such a price you don't generally get RTX 3050 with 16bg ram so overall this laptop meets all the expectations. Even at 70k, this is probably one of the best deals you'll get.üëç
